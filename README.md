# GIS 3 Final Project: Predicting Manhattan Home Sales üè†
by Lily Cao 

For my GIS 3 final project, I wanted to train a model to predict housing prices in Manhattan, New York. 

# **Goals & Objectives** üìå
Though my ultimate goal was to train a model to best predict Manhattan home sales, I also had smaller goals integral to the process. I wanted to include external independent variables not provided by the sales dataset and did so by calculating how many high schools, food vendors, parks, and subway stations were located within a buffer of each home. I also created a fifth independent variable that ranked neighborhood locations based on median incomes. By the end of the project, I will have a) a trained model; b) maps to visualize the predictions; c) prediction results for new data on Manhattan home sales, whether that be from this month or a couple years ago. 

The main reason I chose this topic was to better understand how real estate companies like Zillow estimate homes that are not even on the market. These companies and real estate agents likely use a wide array of models to determine their respective predictions, especially since every type of property and locations has its own specifics. Though the final model will be most useful for people who are thinking of putting their houses on the markets, it will also be useful for those who are considering moving to Manhattan and want to find the best valued home. Furthermore, housing prices are an important indicator of the economy. The data I am using is on rolling sales from the last 12 months (April 2019 ‚Äì March 2020). The coronavirus outbreak will change or is already changing the real estate market and so building a model of data from this timeline will hopefully give insight into housing prices in the midst of this outbreak
